No Menax Sky is a 2D and 3D adventure game about a peasant knight who seeks vengeance against the evil Lord Menax. Equipped either with shield & sword or a magic wand, the young Gauntleto heads towards Lord Menax castle to end him once and for all. During the journey around the castle, Gauntleto will have to face Lord Menax's wicked machinery minions, dodge tricky traps and defeat the terrible wizard Manueleth and the trickster rogue Masiatrix. Only after overcoming all those obstacles will he be able to confront his nemesis, finally bringing peace to his village.

No Menax Sky was developed with our own fully custom engine built around OpenGL and written in C++. Every asset used was also entirely developed by our team or modified from an open source file.

Aside from coding, the members of the team were also involved in different specific roles.
